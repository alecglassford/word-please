💬 It helps you find a word that sounds a way!

## What is this?

This single page web app quickly finds English words that match a pattern you input. (It presents a simplified interface for searching with a subset regular expressions. So chill. 🍧)

## Why is this?

For fun, for puns, for finding the *mot juste* for your writing, for cheating on crosswords, I guess.

I was trying to use [RhymeZone](https://rhymezone.com/) to find a perfect word, but it just wasn't getting me what I wanted. RhymeZone is <span role="img" aria-label="fire">🔥</span>, but it isn't everything.
